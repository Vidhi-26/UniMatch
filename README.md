# UniMatch ~ Post-Secondary Program Finder 

A comprehensive app that assists high school students in finding the most suitable post-secondary program in Canada. The ultimate goal was to make a software program that our peers would truly find useful to decide which post-secondary program to attend. Facilitated communication within the team as Project Manager & personally responsible for implementing and testing the Matching algorithm that matches students to post-secondary programs based on several parameters like genuine interest, courses, grades, extracurriculars, etc. Also developed GUI prototypes using Figma, wrote code documentation, added inspirational music & live links to program websites. Utilized skills including GUI (Swing package), OOP, file handling (importing, storing data), etc.
